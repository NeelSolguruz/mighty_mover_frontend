      ANSWER: `MightyMovers does not take any liability for the goods being shipped unless it is established with a conclusive evidence, that the damage or theft was due to reckless driving. Only in such cases, after the evidence is shared with us, as per law, the transporter's liability is restricted to the lower of:
          1.value of goods damaged; OR
          2.ten times the freight amount paid or payable,
unless a higher risk rate has been charged and agreed to be paid by the Customer. We do not charge a risk rate and our billable rates are purely a factor of utilization of the vehicle (distance + time) without factoring any of the insurable risks or the value of goods being transported. We accept the goods for shipments on said to contain basis. We would recommend to exercise extreme caution in case of transporting extremely fragile / flammable goods or goods which are prone to damage while transporting. If you have any doubts regarding the goods that may be transported on our platform, please refer to our Terms of service or may kindly get in touch with us on 4410 4410.`,
